## Reading Passage

Sarah was on the last day of her trip to Barcelona when she realized her camera was missing.
She had taken dozens of photos during her week-long vacation, and they were all on that camera.
At first, she tried to stay calm and retrace her steps from that morning.

She remembered having the camera at the café where she ate breakfast.
After that, she had walked through the park and visited a small bookstore.
When she returned to the café, the staff said they hadn't found any camera.
Sarah felt her heart sink as she walked to the park.

At the park entrance, she noticed a bulletin board with various notices and advertisements.
Among them, she saw a small note that read: "Found: Black camera near bench #7."
There was a phone number at the bottom.
Sarah immediately called the number with trembling hands.

A kind woman answered and confirmed that she had found the camera that morning.
They agreed to meet at a nearby metro station in thirty minutes.
When Sarah finally got her camera back, she was so relieved that tears came to her eyes.
She tried to offer the woman a reward, but the woman refused and simply said, "I hope someone would do the same for me."
