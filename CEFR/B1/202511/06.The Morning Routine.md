## Reading Passage

Lisa used to wake up feeling stressed every morning.
She would hit the snooze button three or four times before finally getting out of bed.
Then she would rush through her morning, often skipping breakfast and arriving at work feeling exhausted.

One day, her friend suggested she try waking up just thirty minutes earlier.
At first, Lisa thought it was impossible, but she decided to give it a try.
She started going to bed thirty minutes earlier and set her alarm for 6:30 AM instead of 7:00 AM.

The first week was difficult, but Lisa stuck to her new routine.
She used the extra time to drink coffee slowly, do some light stretching, and plan her day.
After two weeks, she noticed she felt calmer and more focused at work.
Her coworkers even commented that she seemed more energetic and positive.

Three months later, Lisa couldn't imagine going back to her old ways.
That simple thirty-minute change had transformed her entire day.
She realized that taking control of her morning meant taking control of her life.
